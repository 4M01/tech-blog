# Cost of Bug

Tester generally get told that they have to catch the bug or have break the software(really?). These are very common terms at least I got exposed very early in my career and I made mistake of not asking why?

What is the role of the tester and what are the responsibilitis is entire different topic to discuss about, but it took me around 10 years to learn that tester's job is not to find the bug or break the software, it is just tiny part, just like portion of the ice-cube the that captain of Titanic saw.

I am writing this clear out what my understanding is about bug and its cost.

Points that you need to understand:

1. Bugs found later are more costly:
   1. developer context switching
   2. tester context switching
   3. reproducibility
   4. time take to fix
   5. re-test
   6. other constraints
2.  No two bugs have the same cost, even the duplicate ones:
    1.  The issue you just reopen after couple of cycle of successful test run. Why would it will have different cost? Cost of context, cost of logging, cost of linking and cost of fixing these are few variable that I can recall right away without thinking too much. If all these variables are going to play some role in cost, statistically it is very unlikely to have the same cost.
